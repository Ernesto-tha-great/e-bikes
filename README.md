# E-Bikes

##This is rendition of the design as part of the test for the Mobile developer role. for O2 Digital. 
##This project was built with react-native, tailwind and google auth.

# Disclaimer

 Certain parts of the design was not implemented pixel perfect for personal preferences for the sake of style. For example, the map has a darkmode as opposed to the light-mode in the design.
There is a settings(user profile really) and Also bottom tabs have a shade of orange as opposed to the default. I should note however that in professional projects, I do NOT impose my own styles.
